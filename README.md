## Experience

### Production and Supply chain
MATS, MAHLE

Jan 2023 – May 2023, Greater Noida, UP
- Redesigned the layout of each production line as per MPS (Mahle production system) standards to achieve max efficiency by the worker
- Designed the Fixtures(gauge) for EGR Cooling module
- Worked on product and line meter (delivery request, FG stock ,synchronization ratio )
- Developed the V MAP (Value stream mapping) for EGR cooling module (exhaust gas recirculation) manufacturing section.
      o	Resulting in the decrement of travel distance of the material by 20% 
      o	Production increment by 15%
      o	Decrease the ideal time of the worker by 10% by positioning the conveyer belt of the frame in the correct position resulting in decreasing the travel distance of worker and increasing the production.
      o	Reduced the man power to 4 from 6 no.
      o	Overall travel distance decrease by 30%


### Design and simulation Intern
DRDO, ARDE

June 2022 – July 2022, Pune, Maharashtra
- Worked on the dynamic simulation of (ASSAULT RIFLE) for case ejection and recoiling using Adams software.

### Drone designing and development intern
IHFC (IIT DELHI), COAL INDIA

March 2022 – Sept 2022, Delhi
- Designed the quad copter from the ground up and improved it by doing dynamic and structural simulations, as well as using MATLAB to estimate certain constraints using supplied data.
- Employed reverse engineering to manufacture the propeller and an FDM printer to manufacture custom-made parts.

### Design and Manufacturing intern
ELECTORQ (BAAZ), IIT DELHI BASED STARTUP

Nov 2021 – Jan 2022, Saket, Delhi
- Designed and optimized the fixture using Solidworks of BAAZ Gen 4, resulting in decreased manufacturing costs for sub parts fixtures including fork assembly, chassis, handle, swing arm, dashboard, stand, etc.
- Worked on swapping station, solved the heating issue of the battery using thin AL plates.
- Solved the fire outbreak issue in emergency case from the battery by using fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) small strips.
